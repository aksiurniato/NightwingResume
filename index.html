    <section><h1>
      Objective</h1>
      <p>To swing into action as a top-tier crime-fighting vigilante or any role that allows me to utilize my acrobatic prowess, keen detective skills, and unparalleled ability to rock a cape with style. </p>
  </section><br>
  <section> <h1>Experience</h1><p><strong>Nightwing (Freelance Crimefighter) | Gotham City | 2014 - Present</strong>
   <br>Mastered the art of swinging through the concrete jungle, dodging bullets, and cracking skulls (figuratively speaking, of course).
    <br>Led the charge against Gotham's most nefarious villains, from the Joker's twisted antics to Two-Face's coin-flipping theatrics.
    <br>Fashioned a costume that strikes fear into the hearts of evildoers while simultaneously being breathable and easy to move in—no small feat!<br><br><br>
    <strong>Robin I (Sidekick Extraordinaire) | Batman Inc. | 2000 - 2013<br></strong>
    Apprenticed under the one and only Caped Crusader, learning the ropes (and grappling hooks) of the superhero game.
    <br>
    Juggled crime-fighting duties with high school homework, because who says you can't kick butt and ace calculus at the same time?
    <br>
    Developed a strong partnership with Batman, proving that dynamic duos are more than just a marketing gimmick.

<section><h1>Skills</h1>
<p>
<strong>
  Acrobatic Mastery
</strong> 
<br>
Trained in the circus arts from a young age, capable of jaw-dropping flips, spins, and dives that leave audiences—and criminals—breathless.
<br><br>
<strong>
  Martial Arts Expertise
</strong>
<br>Proficient in a variety of combat styles, from the ancient disciplines of ninjutsu to the modern street-fighting techniques of Gotham's mean streets.<br>
<br>
<strong>
  Charismatic Banter
</strong>
<br>
Capable of delivering one-liners so cheesy they could disarm even the most hardened villains. If laughter is the best medicine, then I'm the superhero equivalent of a walking pharmacy.
</p></section>
<br>
<section>
<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
<strong>Haly's Circus School of Hard Knocks</strong>
Graduated top of the class in trapeze artistry, tightrope walking, and clowning around (because every hero needs a sense of humor, right?).
<br><br>

Available upon request, though you might want to ask Batman first — he's a tough critic!

<strong>Disclaimer</strong>
<br>
While I may not have a traditional resume format, I promise you won't find another candidate with my unique blend of skills, experience, and panache. And hey, if the whole crime-fighting thing doesn't work out, I hear the circus is always hiring!
